The Home component is the main page of the application, displaying a feed of posts, trending tags, and recent comments.

Features:
	•	Tabs Navigation – Allows users to switch between “New” and “Popular” posts.
	•	Post List – Displays multiple posts with titles, images, authors, timestamps, views, comments, and tags. Each post is editable.
	•	Sidebar Widgets:
	•	TagsBlock – Shows popular tags related to the content.

The layout is built using Material UI’s Grid, ensuring a responsive structure with posts occupying most of the space and sidebar widgets complementing the content.
