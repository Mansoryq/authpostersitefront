**Getting Started with Create React App**

This project was initialized with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

**Available Scripts**

In the project directory, you can run:

**npm start** – Runs the app in development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page reloads on changes, and lint errors appear in the console.

**npm test** – Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. More details [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

**npm run build** – Builds the app for production, optimizing performance. The output is stored in the **build** folder. More details on [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

**npm run eject** – Removes Create React App’s default setup, giving full control over configuration. This is irreversible.
